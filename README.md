Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

I used a combination of static HTML served via Express, traditional JavaScript for dynamic behavior, and a single-page application (SPA) framework to enhance interactivity.
The Express-served HTML and JavaScript offered a simple and quick way to render pages and introduce interactive components. 
However, the SPA provided a more fluid user experience.

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

The backend utilized a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its flexibility with data structures and ability to scale.
MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, making it highly compatible with JavaScript-based environments and the data model adapts really during the entirety of development.

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON is essential for full stack development. It is a lightweight format that is different from Javascript but shares its syntax. JSON communicates with the front and backend.
The frontend sends JSON to API endpoints. During the entire development process, there were opportunities to refactor some of my code. The goal was to reduce any duplications
and improve the maintainability of the application.

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. 
Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

APIs serve as the bridge between the frontend and backend, and it's critical to test their functionality. I utilized GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods to test it. 
Testing these endpoints allowed me to see if my application was working the way I intended it to. I also incorporated security measures as well. JSON web tokens were added 
for admin logins. Postman was also used in testing to see if the application was functional and required the intended security protocols. 

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? 
What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

Every company within every industry uses an application that has gone through this type of process. Going through the full stack process has opened my eyes to how my own 
companies records and information managment repository functions a bit better now. We are currently looking migrate our mainframe applications into the previously mentioned 
repository. Even though I am not on the development side of these meetings, I can put myself into the developers shoes a bit and have a deeper conversation with that team.
